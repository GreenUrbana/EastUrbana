Mayor Diane Marlin
Urbana City Building
400 South Vine Street
Urbana, IL 61801

Dear Mayor,

I am contacting you out of concern about the industrial
emissions from the Emulsicoat Plant at 705 East University Avenue in Urbana. I
am a resident in the East Urbana neighborhood and live at [address]. On numerous occasions I have noticed a certain odor throughout the neighborhood that many have deemed as stemming from the Emulsicoat Plant. Recently, on *[date]* at *[time]* I  observed *[your observations]* at *[location]*. 

In particular I am concerned about the air quality surrounding the industrial site and the potential health concerns of its workers, as well as myself, my family, and my neighbors who live in the Historic East Urbana Neighborhood.

I urge you to take steps to ensure the health and safety of all of Urbana’s residents and to leverage the power of your office to ensure that we are living in a healthy and safe environment.

At minimum, the City of Urbana should work with the Illinois EPA to review and obtain the Safety Data Sheets regarding any chemicals stored at the Emulsicoat Plant. These should include any chemical or material compounds shipped to and stored, or processed, on the industrial site premises. The City of Urbana should also ensure that members of the public are able to understand and interpret these documents.

The city should insist on a surprise set of inspections to the plant by the Illinois and US EPA including inspecting storage tanks on the premises for leaks, rust, and holes that can turn into a hazardous waste spill.

Thank you for your attention to this matter and for your care and concern for Urbana’s residents.

Sincerely,

*[Your name]*

*[Phone]*

*[Email address]*
